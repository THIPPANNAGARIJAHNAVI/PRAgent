Security Guidelines

Sensitive data (passwords/usernames) is logged

Credentials are sent in URL query params

Password input is not using type="password"

Endpoints expose all users

No HTTPS-safe POST request

✅ Performance Guidelines

Missing dependency array in useEffect

Fetch running on every render → infinite re-renders

Unnecessary data fetching

No memoization or optimization

✅ React Best Practices

useState() initialized with undefined instead of ""

Missing [] in useEffect

Hard-coded URLs (no environment variables)

No error handling in fetch

Inline functions inside JSX
